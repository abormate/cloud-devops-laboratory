Let us now build a menu driven calculator program. Develop a script /home/bob/calculator.sh that when run:

Shows a menu driven program with the following options:

Add
Subtract
Multiply
Divide
Quit
Depending on the input the program must ask for 2 numbers - Number1 and Number2 and then print the result in the form Answer=6.

The program must then show the menu again until user selects option 5 to quit.
Note :- Script should be in an executable format, run command chmod +x to make it executable.

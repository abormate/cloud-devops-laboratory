Let's create a new directory for our new mission. Every mission requires a new directory created by the mission name. Create a new directory at /home/bob named lunar-mission.

Note that all future rocket commands must be run from the parent directory of this mission directory. That is /home/bob in your case

mkdir lunar-mission

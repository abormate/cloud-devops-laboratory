# If you place linux commands in series and sequence inside a shell file (*.sh file). The commands will run in order one after another. 
# example for "create-and-launch-rocket.sh" -- sh file doesn't run right away when you type the name of the file, without the "sh" file extension -- much like any generic command in Linux 
# shell script below typed as a command below doesn't run -- will throw an error
create-and-launch-rocket

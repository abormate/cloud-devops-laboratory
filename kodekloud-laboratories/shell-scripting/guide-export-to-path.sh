# If you place linux commands in series and sequence inside a shell file (*.sh file). The commands will run in order one after another. 
# example for "create-and-launch-rocket.sh" -- sh file doesn't run right away when you type the name of the file, without the "sh" file extension -- much like any generic command in Linux 
# shell script below typed as a command below doesn't run -- will throw an error
create-and-launch-rocket

# look for the directories defined in the system PATH
# to do so, run the following command 
echo $PATH

# echo command above, outputs the PATH directories 
# which could look like this as an output --> /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin

Only 32bit VMs are listed in Virtual Box
While creating VMs in the Virtual box if only 32-bit VMS are listed, kindly check on the following:

Check if Virtualization is enabled on your system. For this, you must access the BIOS of your laptop and enable Virtualization if itâ€™s not already enabled.
Check if Hyper-V is enabled on your system. If it is, ensure that it is disabled as two virtualization technologies cannot co-exist.
